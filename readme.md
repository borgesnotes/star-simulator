# Star Simulator for Star Tracker Calibration

![CPP][cpp-shield] ![Qt][qt-shield]

This repository contains the software to control a Star Simulator System and the SphereOptics SMS-500 Spectral Measurement Sensor in order to calibrate a Star Tracker under development at [INPE - Brazilian National Institute for Space Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_for_Space_Research).

## LED-based Spectrally Tunable Light Source

An autonomous star tracker has been designed and is being developed at the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE).

To calibrate the star tracker, a sophisticated infrastructure of tests is required. Among several types of test equipment, this infrastructure also includes a star simulator, which is composed of an LED-based Spectrally Tunable Light Source, a pinhole, and a collimator.

The star simulator is designed to have the capability of producing different continuum spectral distributions, mimicking star magnitudes in the visible and near-infrared range, what is achieved through the feedback control of individual LEDs.
